        At Share and Grow Association (S&GA), recognized as a 501(c)(3) non-profit entity, our heart beats for community service. 
        Our passionate volunteers, both adults and students, dedicate thousands of hours each year without any financial compensation. 
        Together, we create and provide a plethora of free events and services that enrich our community. 
        Our lifeline is the financial support we receive from compassionate individuals, local businesses, and community grants. We stand today because of your generosity, and your continued support is the cornerstone that allows us to enhance and diversify our community services.
